### Hi there 👋
📈 After writing news and editing books, I studied primary care interventions at an academic health center. Now I develop business and clinical intelligence.

💊 Clinical intelligence provides deep information on primary care practice patterns.

🗣️ Presented at state and national conferences on community-engaged research on mental health care, planning safety/quality improvement publications, and the perceptions of patients and health care workers

✍️ Published on how clinic design impacts primary care team efficiency, how different organizational factors drive accountable care costs and savings, and a planning model to guide electronic health record optimization

📰 News writer syndicated across 100+ wires and sites, including Thomson Reuters, LexisNexis, and The New York Times
