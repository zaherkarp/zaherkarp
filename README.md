# Hi, I'm Zaher 👋
**Analytics engineer & product analyst for population health.** I turn messy EHR data into reliable, self-service intelligence that clinicians, ops, and execs can use today.

- Built and scaled analytics for Epic, Cerner, Allscripts, and athenahealth environments
- Ship governed BI with dbt/Airflow/SQL on AWS & Databricks; visualize in Tableau/Power BI/QuickSight
- Focused on value-based care (ACO, MSSP, HEDIS, Stars), workflow design, data governance, and FHIR interoperability

---

## What I build 💊📊
- **Population & clinical intelligence** — Cohorts, care gaps, embedded refills, and payer program tracking
- **Revenue & ROI analytics** — Contract performance, pricing, and pipeline models for leadership & sales
- **Developer-grade BI** — Git-versioned, tested dashboards backed by a warehouse (no more fragile pivots)

---

## Recent impact 📈
- Tracked **multimillion-dollar** revenue for value-based contracts  
- Cut S3/storage costs by **50%** and reduced weekly ETL time by **24 hours**  
- Removed **400+ manual hours/quarter** with governed self-service  
- Grew active users **7×** through simpler, faster dashboards  
- Saved **500+ hours/year** and scaled analytics to **10×** more customers  
- Built ROI models that supported **$1MM+** in recurring revenue

## Selected work 📊
- **Embedded Refills & Care Gaps** — Designed the data model and daily cohort refresh; standardized SQL into stored procedures (~**70% fewer lines**), improved performance and maintainability. *(AWS Redshift, dbt, Airflow, FHIR, Tableau/Power BI)*
- **Revenue & Program Performance** — Benchmarks and trend tracking for ACO/MSSP/HEDIS/Stars; aligned finance & clinical leaders on targets. *(SQL, Python, Tableau)*
- **Warehouse + BI modernization** — Re-architected S3 layout and ETL; replaced ad-hoc spreadsheets with Git-versioned, quality-tested dashboards. *(S3, Redshift, dbt, CI/CD)*

## About me (the short version)
I started as a news writer and book editor, then moved into healthcare research and analytics. That background still shapes how I work today: clear questions, defensible methods, and results that change decisions.
